      Worked on several projects for clients with a focus on Android and
      integration testing with Python.
        - General debugging - worked with logs to identify where a problem 
        occurred and implemented solutions. Languages - C, C++, Java
        - Post-mortem debugging - understand crash dumps and use gdb to 
        identify the relevant pieces of source code where a crash originated. 
        Basic knowledge of assembly instructions
        - Build loadable kernel modules for embedded systems. Created several 
        small Linux drivers utilizing device GPIOs, interrupts, work queues, state 
        machines, writing to registers. Implementation language - C; hardware 
        used - Raspberry Pi 3
        - Created an internal SCM tool, which 
        pulls data using SSH and REST, analyzes it and takes certain actions. 
        Specifically, it requests information for patches in the code review system 
        (Gerrit), determines the relationships between patches and topics (collections 
        of patches), automatically adds 
        all required reviewers, checks for missing commit message attributes, fires 
        Jenkins patch builds for approved patches, emails certain users when certain 
        events occur and others. Different HTML reports can be generated. 
        Implementation language - Java 8
        - Wrote various tests within a specialized test framework for Android devices.
