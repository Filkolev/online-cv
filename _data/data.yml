        - General debugging - working with logs to identify where a problem 
        occurred and, by understanding the system, implementing a solution. 
        Languages - C, C++, Java
        - Post-mortem debugging - understanding crash dumps and using gdb to 
        identify the relevant pieces of source code where a crash originated.
         Basic knowledge of assembly instructions
        - Building loadable kernel modules for embedded systems. Created several 
        small Linux drivers utilizing device GPIOs, interrupts, work queues, state 
        machines, writing to registers. Implementation language - C; hardware used 
        - Raspberry Pi 3
        - Created an internal scm (software configuration management) tool, which 
        pulls data using SSH and REST, analyzes it and takes certain actions. More 
        specifically, it requests information for patches in the code review system 
        (Gerrit), determines the relationships between patches and topics (collections 
        of patches), determines the status of each patch and topic, automatically adds 
        all required reviewers, signals for missing commit message attributes, fires 
        Jenkins patch builds for approved patches, emails certain users when certain 
        events occur and others. Different commands can be used to generate reports; 
        output is in HTML. Implementation language - Java 8
        - Writing various tests within a specialized test framework for Android devices.
